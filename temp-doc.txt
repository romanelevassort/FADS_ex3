5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp- .) command used above?*
The command copies all files from the parent directory (..) whose names start with temp- into the current directory (.). The * works as a wildcard, so it includes all matching files: temp-data.csv, temp-average.py, and temp-doc.txt.

5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?
We did not need to run git init because the folder greends-fads-first-project was already a Git repository. It was created by cloning from GitHub using git clone, which automatically initializes the repository and creates the .git folder.

5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.
Yes, we can commit the copied files. The steps are:
git add temp-data.csv temp-average.py temp-doc.txt
git commit -m "Add files copied from my-first-project"
git push myfork main.
