### 5.1
The command `cp ../temp-* .` uses the `*` character as a wildcard.  
It replaces any sequence of characters, meaning that `temp-*` selects all files starting with `temp-` (for example, `temp-01.txt`, `temp-doc.txt`, `temp-abc.md`).  
The command copies all files whose name starts with `temp-` from the parent folder (`../`) to the current folder (`.`).

### 5.2
We donâ€™t need to use `git init` because we already cloned the repository from GitHub.  
The `git clone` command already brought the `.git` folder and initialized the repository on the computer, so it is not necessary to initialize it again.

### 5.3
Yes, I can send the copied files to Git.  
To do this, I need to add them to the staging area and then create a commit:

```bash
git add temp-*
git commit -m "feat: add temp-* files"
